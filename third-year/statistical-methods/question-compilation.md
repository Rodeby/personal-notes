## 2. Basic Questions
1. Suppose	a	string	of	n bits	is	sent	across	a	lossy	link. In how	many ways can 2 bit errors occur? When n=3, list the possible set of bit error patterns. **[5 marks]**

2. In how many ways can the letters MISSISSIPPI be rearranged? **[10 marks]**

3. In poker a straight flush consists of 5 cards in order, all of the same suit e.g. the 2,3,4,5,6 of clubs. How many straight flushes are possible? **[10 marks]**

4. Six people get into an elevator at the ground floor of a hotel which has 10 upper floors. Assuming each person gets off at a floor uniformly at random, what is the probability that no two people get off at the same floor? **[10 marks]**

5. A random variable X has P(X=x)=x/15 for x=1, 2,3,4,5, and P(X=x) is 0 for all other values. What is the mean and variance of X? **[5 marks]**

6. You	perform the following experiment: you take a six-sided die, and roll it. If the	 number that comes up is six, you stop; otherwise you repeat.  
What is the distribution of the number of times you roll the die? **[5 marks]**  
What is the expected number of rolls? **[10 marks]**

## 3. Using Bayes Rule
1. Suppose we have two bags, labeled A and B.  
 Bag A contains 3 white balls and 1 black ball, bag B contains 1 white ball and 3 black balls.  
 We toss a fair coin and select bag A if it comes up heads and otherwise bag B. 
 From the selected bag we now draw 5 balls, one after another, replacing each ball in the bag after it has been selected (the bag always contains 4 balls each time a ball is drawn).  
 We observe 4 white balls and 1 black ball.  
 What is the probability that we selected bag A ? _(Hint: use Bayes Rule.)_ **[20 points]**

2. State Bayes Rule. **[5 points]**

3. Suppose 1% of computers are infected with a virus. There is an imperfect test for detecting the virus.  
 When applied to a computer with the virus the test gives a positive result 90% of the time.  
 When applied to a computer which does not have the virus, the test gives a negative result 99% of the time.  
 Suppose that the test is positive for a computer. What is the probability that the computer has the virus? **[10 points]**

## 4. Expectations & Random Variables
1. Define the expected value of a random variable. Give a proof that the expected value is linear i.e. E[X+Y]=E[X]+E[Y] for random variables X and Y. **[5 points]**

2. Define what it means for two random variables to be independent. Give a proof that when two random variables X and Y are independent then E[XY]=E[X]E[Y]. **[5 points]**

3. Define the covariance and correlation of two random variables X and Y. **[ 5 points]**

4. You invent a game where the player bets €1, and rolls two dice. If the sum is 7, the player wins €k, and otherwise loses their €1 bet.
 1.  Define the expectation and variance of a discrete random variable. **[5 points]**
 2. What is the expected reward in this game? **[5 points]**
 3. What value of k makes the game fair (i.e. makes the expected reward zero)?	 What is the variance of the reward in this case? **[10 points]**
 4. For two independent random variables X and Y show that Var(X+Y)=Var(X)+Var(Y). Hint: Recall that E[X+Y]=E[X]+E[Y] and that
when X and Y are independent then E[XY]=E[X]E[Y] **[10 points]**
 5. Suppose that you play the game 2 times in a row with k=5. What is the expected value of the reward (i.e. of the aggregate winnings after playing 2 times)? What is its variance ? What is the expectation and variance of the reward after 100 plays? **[5 points]**

## 5. Dunno
1. A bag contains 30 balls, of which 10 are red and the other 20 blue.  
 1. Suppose you take out 8 balls from this bag, with replacement.  
  What is the probability that among the 8 balls in this sample exactly 3 are red and 5 are blue? **[5 points]**
 2. Now suppose that the balls are taken out of the bag without replacement.  
  What is the probability that out of 8 balls exactly 3 are red and 5 are blue? **[10 points]**
  
3. Suppose we roll a red die and a green die:
 1. What is the sample space for this experiment? **[5 points]**
 2. What is the probability that the number on the green die is larger than the number on the red die? **[5 points]**
 3. Define what it means for two events E and F to be independent. **[5 points]**
 4. Let event E be that the sum of the dice equals 2 or 3 and event F be that the sum equals 3. Are E and F independent? Explain with reference to the definition given above. **[10 points]**
