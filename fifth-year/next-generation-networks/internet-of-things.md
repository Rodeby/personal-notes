# Internet of Things

* **IoT** stands for Internet of Things.

* **IIoT** stands for Industrial Internet of Things.

* **M2M** stands for Machine to Machine.

* **MTM** stands for Machine Type Communications.

* IoT, IIoT, M2M, and MTM are all variations on a theme.

* Industry 4.0 IoT will have very high reliability and availability and very low latency.

* The two opposite ends of the MTC scale are Massive MTC and Critical MTC.

* **Massive MTC** examples include:
  * Monitoring building infrastructure
  * Smart agriculture
  * Logistics
  * Tracking
  * Fleet management

* **Massive MTC** devices must be:
  * Architecturally simple
  * Have a low-complexity transmission
  * Have a long battery life (of years)
  * Long transmission ranges for remote devices
  * Scalable networks

* Massive MTC usually refers to services that span a very large number of devices, which are usually sensors and actuators.

* **Critical MTC** examples include:
  * Traffic safety & control
  * Control of critical infrastructure
  * Wireless connectivity for industrial processes

* In Critical MTC, monitoring and control happen in real time.

* **E2E** stands for End to End.

* In Critical MTC, E2E latency requirements are at milliseconds level, which is very low.

* In Critical MTC, the need for reliability is high.

* Low cost and energy consumption are of less importance for Critical MTC devices.

* 5G aims to support Critical IoT users.

* The main differences between 5G and 4G are:
  * Increased resilience: 99.999% more uptime
  * Ultra low latency: < 5ms round trip times

* 5G will have to have points of presence for data storage and computation much closer to where the control is required, to address the latency objectives.

* **Network Slicing** is a specific form of virtualization that allows multiple logical networks to run on top of a shared physical network infrastructure.

* 5G networks will have to be highly customisable, using network slicing, to address various sectors.

* A network that can handle many applications on the same wireless-access technology within the same spectrum has a lot of benefits:
  * Avoids spectrum fragmentation
  * Allows support for new unimagined IoT services without deploying a separate network
  * Allows spectrum to be reassigned specifically for these new applications

* **Signaling** is the exchange of information between involved points in the network that sets up, controls, and terminates the connection.

* Signaling is the dominant part of the overall traffic from massive IoT devices.

* Network slices that support the IoT need for scalability can be optimized and reduce signaling. But 4G and 5G are not ready for this yet.

## LPWAN

* **LPWAN** stands for Low Power Wide Area Network.

* LPWAN:
  * Supports small messages with specific duty cycles.
  * Has devices with long (10 years) battery lives.
  * Suits access very remote sensors. (in-building 500m-3km & rural up to 30km)
  * Has a cost point that suits end applications.

* The aim of LPWAN is to support many devices that are cheap and transmit small infrequent messages.

* LPWANS are similar to mobile networks, but use lower frequencies and more robust signals.

* **NLOS** stands for Non-Line of Sight. **LOS** stands for Line of Sight.

* **BOM** stands for Bill of Materials, is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts, and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product.

* BOM of devices must be low if they are to be deployed at scale.

* The immaturity of LWPAN applications makes it difficult to design MAC/Network schemes that support emerging applications.

## LoRa

* **LoRa** stands for Long Range.

* LoRa operates in the 868MHz band.

* LoRa operates in the unlicensed spectrum.

* Here is some top points about LoRa:
  * 868MHz technology
  * Spread spectrum based (very robust to noise)
  * Bidirectional
  * 250bps to 50kbps
  * Up to 154 dB uplink
  * Battery based end-devices

* **PHY** is an abbreviations for the physical layer of the OSI stack.

* **RAN** stands for Radio Access Network.

* **LPWAN** is a technology that supports small messages with specific duty cycles.
