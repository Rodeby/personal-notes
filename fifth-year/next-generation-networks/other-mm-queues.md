# Other M/M/... Queues

* An **M/M/1/N** system has a finite buffer, with a capacity of N.

* An **M/M/m** system has m servers.

* An **M/M/∞** system has infinite servers, which means no queuing.

* **Blocking Probability** is the probability that an arriving customer will find the system full.

* **P<sub>n</sub>** is the blocking probability.

* The **Rate of Rejected customers** is λ * P<sub>n</sub>.

TODO: didn't finish notes for these equation slides.
