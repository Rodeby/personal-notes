# Optical Transmission Technology

* The typical path loss of optical fibre is 0.2dB/Km.

* Signal can go 150km in optical fibre without amplification.

* Static current produces an EMF in a wire and variable current produces a varying EMF and radiates energy.

* Pairs of wire emit and receive radiation. Going and returning current have opposite sign, so their interference cancels out.

* Twisting pairs of copper wires helps to reduce interference from external sources.

* Coaxial cables have a tube of conducting material around the wires, and sometimes a tube of insulating material around this. This means that they induce less of a current on other wires.

* **Total Internal Reflection** is a process where a ray of light meets a less dense medium at an angle that exceeds the critical angle, causing the light to reflect (somewhat [for the most part]) completely. The critical angle is dependent on the difference in the densities of the media.

* Optical fibres work by total internal reflection.

* Optical communications are achieved by transmitting pulses.

* Each pulse is made up of a number of adjacent frequencies.

* **Modal dispersion** is a distortion mechanism in optical fibres. Pulses of light which are made up of several rays of light, reflect at slightly different angles. This means that the propagation velocity of all the modes (rays) is not the same, and they become out of sync.

* **Intersymbol Interference** is where multiple pulses in optical fibres end up overlapping.

* Optical fibres can be **Multi-mode** fibre, which have a larger core that allows for multiple modes to coexist inside the fibre, or **Single-mode** fibre which only has enough space in the core for one mode to propagate. Single-mode fibre is used more in telecommunications.

* **Path Loss** is the loss of power as a signal propagates.

* **Dispersion** is distortion due to the fact that the refractive index is dependent on frequency rather than being constant.

* The three types of Dispersion are:
  * Modal Dispersion (see above).
  * **Chromatic Dispersion**, which is due to different frequencies within a single mode propagating at different speeds.
  * **[Polarization mode dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_mode_dispersion)**.

* Modal Dispersion has the biggest effect of any dispersion.

*TODO: The material gets quite heavy here, and I was not sure that it was beneficial to take down such in depth physics, but perhaps it is necessary to know the material at the end of this section in such detail.*
