# Optical Transmitters and Receivers

* **Laser** stands for Light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.

* Lasers emit photons of light that all have the same frequency and phase.

* Tunable lasers can emit light at different wavelengths within a predetermined range.

* **Modulation** is used to add information to a carrier signal.

* On-off modulation is still the most common form of modulation.

* Direct laser modulation is achieved by turning a laser off and on.

* External modulation is achieved by intermittently obscuring the light from a laser.

* A **Photodetector** converts an optical signal into an electric signal.

* **Coherent Detection Systems** can detect phase as well as signal amplitude.

* The higher sensitivity of coherent receivers allows for different modulation schemes with higher spectral efficiency.
