# Cognitive Radio

* **Software Defined Radio** is a collection of hardware and software components that enable reconfigurable systems for wireless networks and user terminals.

* A **Cognitive Radio** is a radio that is aware of and can sense its environment, and make decisions about how to operate based on this information and its pre-defined objectives.

* A **Cognitive Radio** is also defined as a A transceiver that is aware, adaptive, and capable of learning from experience.

* A cognitive radio is aware of:
  * The RF environment
  * Its own capabilities
  * The policies it needs to follow
  * Local and Global objectives
  * Network conditions
  * Other user's priorities and authorisations

* A cognitive radio can adapt,
  * Control of transmit power
  * Selecting its dynamic waveform
  * Accessing dynamic spectrum
  * Routing
  * Negotiating waveforms and protocols

* A cognitive radio can learn,
  * Having an experience-weighted lookup table.
  * Using machine learning algorithms.

The general elements of a cognitive radio are shown below:

|Element|Components|
|---|---|
|Objectives|Maximise SNR and data rate|
|Variables|Frequency of operation, Power, and Waveform|
|Stimuli|Occupied bands, Signal strength, Neighbour list|
|Policies|Allowed frequency bands for primary or secondary use|

* The desirable features of a cognitive radio are:
  * A wide band
  * The ability to transmit any waveform
  * A flexible architecture
  * High performance
  * Low power consumption
  * Affordability
  * Accessibility
  * Straightforward to use and develop for
  * Robust
  * Access to suitable frequency spectrum segments for innovation and testing

* The basis of a cognitive radio could be any software defined radio, since it builds on top of the components of an SDR.

* Applications of cognitive radio include:
  * Dynamic spectrum access (DSA)
  * Cooperative medium access and communications
  * Opportunistic switching between wireless networks
  * Adaptive selection of available radio resources
  * Increased interoperability of different systems (spectrum sharing)

* A **Femtocell** is a small cellular base station for residential or business installation.

* Femtocells are cheap and easy to deploy.

* Femtocells can use the same frequency bands as the conventional cellular network, which means that they can cause interference with the WAN if the spectrum is not shared properly.

* **Self-Organising Networks** can automatically extend, change, configure and optimise their topology, coverage, channel allocation and other operating parameters.
