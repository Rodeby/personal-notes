# Self Organising Networks

### Characteristics of Complex Adaptive Systems

|Characteristic|Meaning|
|---|---|
|1. Non-linearity|Small actions can generate large reactions.|
|2. Emergence|Patterns which can not be planned or intended begin to appear due to collective behaviour.|
|3. Dynamical systems change|Subsystem interactions are volatile and cascade rapidly.|
|4. Adaptation|The system is a function of adaptation of elements to each other and their environment.|
|5. Uncertainty|Processes and outcomes are unpredictable.|
|6. Co-evolutionary|Agents self organise and connections emerge that become co-evolutionary as the agents evolve together.|

* CA stands for cellular automata and ABM stands for agent based modelling.

* Cellular Automata is to do with cellular lattices, and is a subject of mathematical study.

* An ABM **Agent** is anything that makes a decision in a network.

* An ABM agent has its own goals and behaviours.

* An AGM agent operates in parallel with other ABM agents.

* An ABM agent can be adaptive.

* ABM agents have no central command.

* ABM agents can exist on different levels.

* The ABM agent cycle is a cycle of Act -> Get Stimulus -> Process Stimulus -> Act -> ...
