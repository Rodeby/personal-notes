# Fixed Access Networks

* Optical communications developed from the core to the metro, because this meant that more users would gain faster.

* The network is not designed for every user to operate all together at maximum capacity, so this means capacity doesn't have to be as much aggregation times capacity.

* The capacity of access connections are typically lower than those in the metro and core.

* It is an issue to upgrade access networks as each access link only feeds one user so the cost per user is high compared to the core.

* The copper link is the slowed part of the network usually. To reduce the distance of the copper link, we can replace the first part of the copper (that
shared by most users) with fibre.

* **FTTC** is Fibre to the Cabinet, which means there is a fibre connection all the way to the cabinet (from the core).

* The main feature of FTTC is that a twisted copper pair is used in part of the connection.

* **Vectoring** applies noise cancellation to a line of adjacent copper pairs.

* **DP** stands for Distribution Point. It is even closer to the cabinet (potentially on your street).

* **FTTDp** stands for Fibre to the Distribution point.

* **PON** stands for Passive Optical Networks.

* **FTTH** stands for Fibre to the Home.

* FTTH is Point to Point fibre.
