# Concepts of Optical Link Design

* **BER** stands for bit error rate.

* **OSNR** stands for optical signal to noise ratio.

* The concept of a **Power Penalty** is the increase in receiver input power needed to eliminate the degradation of BER due to fibre impairments.

* There are three types of noise in optical systems:
  * **ASE** (Amplified Spontaneous Emission) is when amplifiers (as well as amplifying the signal) also introduce their own noise.
  * **Thermal Noise** due to the random thermal-driven motion of electrons at the receiver.
  * **Shot Noise** due to photons arriving at the receiver at a sort of random time (when considered at a quantum level).

* **NF** can stand for noise figure, which is a measure of the amount of noise introduced to a system by an amplifier.

* Signal regenerators read a signal, and re-emit a signal that represents that signal's data. (gets rid of noise)

* There is a high cost of using a lot of signal regenerators.

*TODO: Some material was not taken note of down due to its heavy - in depth nature. I'm not certain that that much depth is necessary.*

* **WDM** stands for Wavelength Division Multiplexing. (TODO: What is WDM?)
