# Overview of Wireless Networks

* Wireless networks can be **Nomadic**, where every node is relatively stationary, or **Mobile** where nodes move around.

* **Mobile** networking involves seamless roaming, wireless telephony, mobile data services, vehicular ad-hoc networks and location-aware services.

* In **Nomadic** networking, the users change their point of connection to the network. Seamless roaming is not necessary in nomadic networking.

* Nomadic networking includes LANs, hotspots, and wireless ISPs. (IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth)

Here is a reference for the OSI networking model:

|Layer|Processes|
|---|---|
|Application|Application specific exchange of messages.|
|Transport|Reliable delivery, Error Control, and Congestion Control.|
|Network|Routing, Handover, Network Addressing, and Device Location.|
|Data link|Medium Access and Error Control.|
|Physical|Frequency Selection, Modulation, Signal Detection, and Encryption.|

* **Handoff** (or Handover) is to do with handing a device from one network to another.

*TODO: I have not taken down what sort of frequency ranges each type of networking protocols use.*

* Regulators handle standardisation and frequency planning.

* **ComReg** stands for Commission for Communications Regulation. Which is the general communications regulator in Ireland.

* The term **Harmonization** is used when describing how it would be desirable if there was a world-wide coordination of spectrum utilisation.

* Harmonization is difficult because of legacy systems.

* Harmonization if of interest for economic reasons.

* The ITU-R is an international regulator. The ITU-R periodically holds the World Radio Conference where the allocation of the spectrum to different services is decided.

* It is very difficult to take spectrum back from those licensed to use a certain band.

* **Dynamic Spectrum Access** allows operation in licensed frequency bands, as long as it doesnâ€™t interfere with holder of the license for that band.

* Cognitive radios implement dynamic spectrum access.

* Transmissions with low frequencies attenuate less with distance. This makes low frequencies ideal for long range transmissions.

## The Complementarity of Wired & Wireless Systems

* "Wired and Wireless networks can be thought of as complementary."

* Optical fibre does not go everywhere.

* Optical fibre provides a huge amount of available bandwidth.

* Wireless networks go almost everywhere.

* Wireless networks have a highly bandwidth constrained transmission channel, which is susceptible to a variety of impairments.
