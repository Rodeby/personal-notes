# Mobile Architectures: LTE, LTE-A, LTE-A-PRO

* **LTE** is 4G. It stands for Long-Term Evolution.

* The evolution of cellular systems is driven by:
  * Exponential increase in demand
  * Support for higher data rates
  * A need for lower latency
  * Flexibility in spectrum use
  * Lower operating expenses for network operators

* **DL** and **UL** stand for Download and Upload.

* LTE objectives were:
  * 100Mbps peak DL & 50Mbps peak UL
  * Backwards compatibility
  * Wide application

* **Latency** is the time that passes from a user making a request to getting a response.

* **OFDM** stands for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing.

* **OFDMA** stands for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access.

* OFDM & OFDMA are features of LTE.

* LTE has spectrum flexibility - it operates in a wide range of spectrum.

* OFDM uses a large number of narrow subcarriers for multi-carrier transmission.

* **LTE+** is LTE Advanced, or LTE-A. It has the same goals as LTE but better.

* **LTE-A-Pro** is LTE Advanced Pro.

* Battery lifetime is not of major interest to cellular base stations.
