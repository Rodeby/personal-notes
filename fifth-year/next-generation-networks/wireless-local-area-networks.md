# Wireless Local Area Networks: IEEE 802.11

* WLANs are simple because they are easy to install, and have no additional cabling.

* WLANs are relatively robust to disasters.

* WLANs can be deployed spontaneously.

* WLANs are cheap.

* Typically, the throughput of WLANs is lower than wired counterparts.

* There are multiple standards for WLANs, with overlapping bands.

* It is easy to eavesdrop on WLANs.

* Infrared can be used for short point-to-point data transfer.

* Infrared's senders are LEDs or Laser Diodes, and its receivers are photodiodes.

* Most wireless networks use radio frequency.

* Infrared needs no license, has cheap sensors and receivers and doesn't interfere with electric devices.

* Infrared doesn't have as high a data rate as radio and is easily blocked by obstacles.

* Radio can travel a long distance and has much higher data rates than infrared.

* Radio is limited to certain frequency bands and is subject to a lot of interference.

* **Infrastructure Based** networks have access points. In **Ad-Hoc** networks, stations communicate directly with one and another.
