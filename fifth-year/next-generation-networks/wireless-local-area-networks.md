# Wireless Local Area Networks: IEEE 802.11

* WLANs are simple because they are easy to install, and have no additional cabling.

* WLANs are relatively robust to disasters.

* WLANs can be deployed spontaneously.

* WLANs are cheap.

* Typically, the throughput of WLANs is lower than wired counterparts.

* There are multiple standards for WLANs, with overlapping bands.

* It is easy to eavesdrop on WLANs.

* Infrared can be used for short point-to-point data transfer.

* Infrared's senders are LEDs or Laser Diodes, and its receivers are photodiodes.

* Most wireless networks use radio frequency.

* Infrared needs no license, has cheap sensors and receivers and doesn't interfere with electric devices.

* Infrared doesn't have as high a data rate as radio and is easily blocked by obstacles.

* Radio can travel a long distance and has much higher data rates than infrared.

* Radio is limited to certain frequency bands and is subject to a lot of interference.

* **ISM** stands for Industrial, Scientific and Medical.

* **Infrastructure Based** networks have access points. In **Ad-Hoc** networks, stations communicate directly with one and another.

* Applications of Infrastructure based networks are:
  * Office-wide WLANs
  * Hotspots

* Applications of Ad-Hoc based networks are:
  * Military / Combat environments
  * Impromptu meetings
  * Sensor Networks
  * Vehicular Networks

* Pros of **IEEE 802.11a**:
  * Fastest Maximum speed (of a/b/g/no letter)
  * Supports more simultaneous users
  * Less interference from other users

* Cons of **IEEE 802.11a**:
  * Highest cost
  * Shortest range signal
  * More easily obstructed
  * Not compatible with 802.11b/g

* Pros of **IEEE 802.11b**:
  * Lowest cost
  * Longest range
  * Not easily obstructed

* Cons of **IEEE 802.11b**:
  * Slowest data rates
  * Other appliances may interfere in the same frequency band

* Pros of **IEEE 802.11g**:
  * Longest range
  * Higher data rates than 802.11b
  * Supports more simultaneous users
  * Not easily obstructed

* Cons of **IEEE 802.11g**:
  * More expensive than 802.11b
  * Other appliances may interfere in the same frequency band

* **IEEE 802.11n** has a higher data rate by using MIMO (multiple input multiple output) techniques. It operates at 2.4GHz and/or 5GHz.

* **IEEE 802.11ad** (**WiGig**) is next gen, with:
  * Data throughput of 7Gbps
  * 60GHz ISM band (large bandwidth and less interference)
  * A range of only a few metres

* Of *Disaster Aftermath*, *Airport Hotspot*, and *Vehicular Networks*, Ad-Hoc architecture is least indicated for Airport Hotspot. As Airport hotspot can easily rely on the
support of an infrastructure,
