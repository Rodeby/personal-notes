## Part A

### 1

#### 1a)

WLANs have a lot of benefits, including:
  * They are easy to install as they have no additional cabling.
  * They are robust to disasters, as disasters tend not to affect the wireless medium.
  * They can be deployed spontaneously.
  * They remove the need for having many cables for connecting devices.
  * It costs less to set up a WLAN than to install cabling for all devices that need connectivity.


Corresponding examples to the above benefits are:
  * Non-technical users can plug in a new router with minimal instructions and create a WLAN.
  * In an earthquake, wired connections may be broken however wireless connections will not be.
  * In the aftermath of an earthquake, if there needs to be connectivity at a relief zone, a simple WLAN can be set up whereas cabling all devices that need connectivity would take time.

#### 1b)

In infrastructure-based WLANs a base station acts as a wireless access point hub, and nodes communicate through the hub. This is the case with most WiFi networks, such as students' connection to the WiFi in Trinity.

An ad hoc network is a network where stations communicate only peer to peer (P2P). There is no base and no one gives permission to talk. The network is ad hoc because it does not rely on a pre-existing infrastructure, such as routers or access points.
