# Wireless local area networks: HetNet, small cell deployments, & mmWave

* Here are three ways to cope with the demand for higher capacity:
  * Radio Efficiency (more bps over the same link)
  * Spectum (get more spectrum)
  * Topology (add more nodes in the wireless infrastructure)

* **Ultra Dense Networks** have a load of access points. They usually have lots of small-cell base stations.

* **HomNet** has a few macro-cell base stations and user's mobile terminals.

* **HetNet** has a few macro-cell base stations, small-cell base stations, and user's mobile terminals.

* **HomNet** is a homogenous network. **HetNet** is a heterogenous network.

* HetNets have:
  * Improved coverage for end users
  * Higher Throughput

* Throughput has an upper-bound because of the effect of inter-cell interference.

* There is much interference in HetNet because nodes share the same frequency band and the same radio access technology.

* Issues with HetNet include:
  * Performance degradation due to inter-cell interference
  * Inter-cell signalling overhead
  * Need for self-organisation
  * Complex planning of radio resources

* **TH** can sometimes stand for Throughput.

TODO: Skimming a bit here

* **PAN** can stand for Personal Area Network.

* **VANET** stands for Vehicular Ad-Hoc network.

* There is a huge amount of spectrum available in the mmWave bands.

* mmWave are used in LAN, PAN, and VANET.

* mmWave links are used in backhaul cellular networks.

* Some advantages of millimeter wave spectrum are:
  * Smaller antennae
  * Different propogation models
  * Shared license access to reduce cost
  * Cognitive radio for shared spectrum between satellite or radar

* The **K-band** is 18-27GHz.

* The **Ka-band** is 26.5-40GHz.

* **V2X** stands for Vehicle to Everything.

* **Blockage** refers to physical objects getting in the way of signal transmission.

* Implications of blockage include:
  * Users indoors not being covered by outdoor infrastructure
  * Impact of interference reduced

* **MIMO** stands for Muliple Input Multiple Output.

* **UE** stands for User Equipment.

* **BS** stands for Base station.

* In an Ultra Dense network there are more base stations than user equipment.

* **Reuse 3-1** means that Macro BSs use 1/3 of the bandwidth and Pico BSs use all of the bandwidth.

* **Reuse 1-1** means that both Macro BSs and Pico BSs use all of the bandwidth.

* **Orthogonal Assignment** means that different tiers (e.g. Macro / Pico BSs) are assigned different sections of the bandwidth. (in the example, Macro share 1/3 and Pico share 2/3)
