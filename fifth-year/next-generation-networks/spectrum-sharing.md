# Spectrum Sharing

* **License Exempt** bands are bands in which one can operate without a license.

* License Exempt bands are good for:
  * Facilitating market entry.
  * Enabling niche applications or services to be addressed quickly and cheaply using existing technology and spectrum.
  * Secure of tenure (users have no license-expiry date).
  * Causing a reduction of congestion in licensed bands.
  * The ability to extend the reach of fixed communication networks, by providing wireless local area connectivity in homes, businesses and at public traffic hotspots.

* The benefits of license exempt bands from an end-user's perspective include:
  * Convenience of less lengthy cables at home or work.
  * The ability to connect to a fixed broadband rather than depending on the mobile network.
  * Convenience of the ability to install low cost wireless alarm systems or to use beeper car keys.

* There are rules for unlicensed bands. These rules keep it possible for multiple devices to co-exist in the band.

* **CSMA/CA** makes facilitates good spectrum access for Wi-Fi, even when in highly contended environments.

* **LTE** is 4G. It stands for Long-Term Evolution.

* Wi-Fi is sort-of derived from Wireless Fidelity.

* **Wi-Gig** (802.11ad) operates in the 60GHz millimetre waveband, and is intended for very high speed, short range applications.

* Wi-Gig expected to deliver up to 7Gpbs over ranges of up to 10 meters.

* 802.11ay is being developed by the IEEE and is aiming at data rates in excess of 30 Gbps, which would allow full movies to be downloaded in a second.

* Nicola refers to 5GHz as *"The promised land of unlicensed capability"* (TODO not sure why...).

* The 71-76GHz band is not relevant in the context of cognitive radio systems' coexistence with radar systems.

TODO... sort of ran out of steam here for the time being.
