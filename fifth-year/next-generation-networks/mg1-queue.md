# M/G/1 Queue

* Exponential service times might not be good assumptions because:
  * Some networks have fixed packet sizes
  * There are limits on packet sizes, even when not fixed

* **M/G/1** queue has general distributions of service times.

* In M/G/1, the state space is no longer discrete.

*  The **"P-K Formula"** stands for the Pollaczek-Khinchin formula. The P-K formula provides results for the M/G/1 queue.

* **i.i.d** stands for Independently and Identically Distributed.

* The **Residual Service Time** is the amount of time in service left for the current customer once arriving customers find the server busy.

TODO: Skipping a lot of heavy equations here.
