## Q3

## Q3a)

* First of all, it should be open source. So that any NGO can take the system, deploy it and host it themselves.
* Privacy and security would be helped through open-sourcing, as the open-source community are likely to point out holes in the system.
* The interface should be familiar, e.g. similar to other popular online sharing platforms in order for the employees to be able to use it.
* It would be best to minimise the use of 3rd party services for the system in the interest of privacy (minimise to none if possible).
* Traffic must be hidden from the government, so solely HTTPS should be used where possible.
* Enforcing that users must be connected to the NGO's network to access / share information is desirable. This could be done "at home" and "abroad" using VPNs if the steps in establishing connections could be conveyed easily enough to the non-technical employees through training etc.
* Certain other functionality could be provided without the necessity of being on the NGO's network (for the non-employees).

More Requirements make sure you're protected against:

Spam, phishing, malware, availability,
MUAs that render active content,
abuse of content if 3rd parties used,
spear phishing,

## Q3b)

|||
|---|---|
|Make sure that stolen passwords are not enough to get into the system | Require 2FA for every employee |
|Certain functionality provided off the NGOs' networks | DMZ for this functionality |
|Spam |Have strong anti-spam filters|
|Phishing | Educate employees, conduct training sessions, have personnel that employees can contact if they are suspicious of an email. Require 2FA so that stolen information from successful phishing attempts will be of no use without the second authentication device. Restrict each employee's access in the system to only the parts of the system that they are required to have access to, this means that successful phishing attempts will get access to less of the system. Restrict access to networks with a VPN, with 2FA on the VPN as well, so that malicious actors must be on the network to even use credentials they may have stolen.|
|MUAs render active content| Educate employees about the risks. Recommend that employees use particular MUAs with specific set ups where possible. |
|Availability| Make sure the proper infrastructure is in place for employees to easily connect to the company network from anywhere through the use of a VPN. Preferably using 2FA to connect to the VPN. Have DOS protection from load balancers.|
