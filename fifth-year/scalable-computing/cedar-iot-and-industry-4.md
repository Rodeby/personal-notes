# CeDAR, IoT & Industry 4.0

## CeDAR

* **CeADAR** is the National Technology Centre for Applied Data Analytics Research.

* CeADAR is funded by EI (Enterprise Ireland) the and IDA (Industrial Development Authority).

* **R&D** stands for research and development.

* CeDAR does applied R&D targeted at industry challenges.

* Some areas that CeDAR are involved in include:
  * Machine Learning
  * Big Data
  * Predictive Analytics
  * Real-time Analytics
  * Blockchain
  * Deep Learning

* CeDAR *bridges the gap between university and enterprise*, by taking technology validated in lab environments and bringing it to an operational system in a commercial application.

## IoT & WSN

* **WSN** stands for Wireless Sensor Networks.

* **UMG** stands for Ubiquitous Mobile Gradient *(at least, I think it does)*.

* UMG is a routing protocol for ad-hoc multi-hop wireless networks.

* **TinyTorrents** is a data distribution protocol. It is Bittorrent for Wireless Sensor Networks.

## Industry 4.0

* **Industry 4.0** is a name given to the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies.

* Industry 4.0 is a paradigm shift from centralised to decentralised smart manufacturing and production.

* **Predictive Maintenance** is the prediction of fault or failure in machinery through its sensor data analysis.

* **Corrective Maintenance** is "Fix it after it's broken", which has a high cost over time.

* **Planned Maintenance** is "Fix it before it breaks", which involves scheduling and coordination.

* **Predictive Maintenance** is "Don't repair it. Eliminate the root cause.", which extends machine life and reduces labour.

* Predictive Maintenance involves:
  * Continuous data collection
  * Data aggregation
  * Data analysis

* Classification in predictive maintenance involves identifying multiple categorical parameters and common behaviours before faults and failures.

* Regresssion in predictive maintenance is the remaining useful life or time to failure of the machine.
