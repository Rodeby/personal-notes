# CPUs and GPUs

* **FLOPS** are Floating-point Operations Per Second

* Computing power is measured in FLOPS.

* Hardware manufactures do not agree on what exactly a FLOP is. Commonly accepted answers are 1 multiply-accumulate or 1 fused multiply-add.

* TOP500 is the list of the 500 most powerful computers.

* GREEN500 is the list of the 500 most energy-efficient.

* Inefficient compute resources require lots of cooling.

* More power is used if compute resources are inefficient.

* Data centres have to be built specifically to cool machines.

* **Moore's Law** is that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

* Transistors smaller than 7 nm will experience quantum tunnelling through the gate oxide layer. Due to costs involved with transistors smaller than this, Moore's Law will hit the **Quantum Wall** at 5nm.

* **Dennard Scaling** is that transistor power is proportional to area.

* **Koomey's Law** is that efficiency doubles every 1.57 years.

* Apparently, physics is getting in the way of computers getting much better, so we need to have more computers instead of better ones.
