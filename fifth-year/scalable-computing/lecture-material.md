# Lecture Material

*There are not much notes on the material, as each non-guest lecture is essentially one bare enough slide of content or a JPG of a blackboard with several words on it.*

## Overall

* The properties of scalable computing are:
  * Scalable - *"how big is big"*
  * Adaptive - *"how easily reconfigurable and repurposed"*
  * Dispersed - *"tasks, resources, nodes, processes"*
  * Accessible - *"human, machine"*
  * Affordable - *"devices, comms, energy, deployment"*
  * Reliable - *"lifetime, MTBF, consequences"*

* The Domains involved in scalable computing are:
  * Internet of Things
  * Processing Units: CPUs & GPUs
  * Functional Groupings: Cluster, Grid Cloud
  * Nano Architectures
  * Quantum Architectures

* Scalable computing encompasses:
  * Processing
  * Computation
  * Data
  * Communications; carriers, systems, and protocols
  * Proximity: Location and Distance
  * Trust, Security and P2P

* The concepts involved in scalable computing are:
  * Horizontal and Vertical Scaling
  * Self Organisation
  * Adaptation
  * Tuning

## Internet of Things

* **IoT** stands for Internet of Things.

* The scale of Internet of Things is billions of devices.

* IoT have **intermittent connectivity**. They do not always have a connection, and are not always powered up.

* It is beneficial to have IoT devices not always powered on, because the conservation of energy is a concern.

* A concern of IoT devices is when to wake them up.

* A **Duty Cycle** is the cycle of operation of a device which operates intermittently rather than continuously.

* Duty cycles are used to wake up IoT devices intermittently in order for them to communicate at intervals and conserve power.

* Duty cycles have to be planned in such a way that transmitters are sending while receivers are listening.

* IoT devices have constraints in:
  * Processing Power
  * Memory
  * Device Resources

* The following are also of concern for IoT:
  * Trust and Security
  * Size, Shape, and Design
  * Deployment

* According to Ciaran, these are properties of IoT:
  * Scalable
  * Adaptive
  * Dispersed
  * Reliable

* There are vehicular use cases for IoT.

## IoT Vehicular Discussion

* When thinking of the benefit of **Vehicular-Peer Tracker Benefit**, the following should be considered:
  * Cloud
  * Edge Cloud
  * Vehicle
  * Occupant Perspective

## Processing Units

* Here are some key words associated with CPUs:
  * Frequency
  * Performance
  * Parallelism
  * Partitioning
  * Communication
  * Agglomeration
  * Mapping
  * Multi-Core
  * Algorithms
  * Tools

* Here are some things related to GPUs
  * Weak and Strong Scaling
  * The efficiency of small domains using multiple GPUs
  * Hash cracking benefits
  * ASICs
  * Bitcoin Miners
