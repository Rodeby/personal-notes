# Probabilistic Retrieval - BM25

* The **Probability Ranking Principle** *(roughly)* states that if an IR system ranks documents in decreasing relevance to a user's query, based on the probabilities that they are relevant (using whatever data is available), the overall effectiveness is the best it can do with the data made available. *(🤷‍♂️)*


* The notation **P(A|B)** means: The probability of A *given* B.

* In an IR system that assumes binary relevance, a document is relevant if P(R|D) > P(NR|D).

* P(R|D) > P(NR|D) is known as a **Bayes Decision Rule** and a system that classifies documents this way is known as a **Bayes Classifier**.
