## Recursion

### Maximum awesome

The function `maximum` returns the maximum element from a list of instances of the `Ord` typeclass.

### A few more recursive functions

`Num` is not a subclass of `Ord`, so both class constraints must be specified if doing addition or subtraction and also comparison.
