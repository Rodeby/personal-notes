These are notes that I made while reading through 'Learn You a Haskell'.

1. [Introduction](https://github.com/nating/personal-notes/blob/master/fourth-year/functional-programming/learn-you-a-haskell-notes/0-introduction.md)
2. [Starting Out](https://github.com/nating/personal-notes/blob/master/fourth-year/functional-programming/learn-you-a-haskell-notes/1-starting-out.md)
3. [Types & TypeClasses](https://github.com/nating/personal-notes/blob/master/fourth-year/functional-programming/learn-you-a-haskell-notes/2-types-and-typeclasses.md)
4. [Syntax in Functions](https://github.com/nating/personal-notes/blob/master/fourth-year/functional-programming/learn-you-a-haskell-notes/3-syntax-in-functions.md)
5. [Recursion](https://github.com/nating/personal-notes/blob/master/fourth-year/functional-programming/learn-you-a-haskell-notes/4-recursion.md)
6. [Higher Order Functions](https://github.com/nating/personal-notes/blob/master/fourth-year/functional-programming/learn-you-a-haskell-notes/5-higher-order-functions.md)
7. [Modules](https://github.com/nating/personal-notes/blob/master/fourth-year/functional-programming/learn-you-a-haskell-notes/6-modules.md) (Didn't do much notes for this one. You'll have to read the list of module functions for yourself!)

... Didn't get to the rest, sorry! :)

8. [Making our own Types and TypeClasses]
9. [Input & Output]
10. [Functionally Solving Problems]
11. [Functors, Applicative Functors & Monads]
12. [A Fistful of Monads]
13. [For a Few Monads More]
14. [Zippers]
