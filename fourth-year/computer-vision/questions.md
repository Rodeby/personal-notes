## Past Questions

Computer Vision (CS4053) 2017

### 2017
1. Find people who try enter an office from a corridor, then get a full frontal image of them.
2. Find the road markings splitting the cycle lane from main road in a video feed perpendicular to the road, then count the number of cyclists who pass.
3. Compare HLS & RGB, then stitch photos into a panorama making use of SIFT.

### 2016
1. Compare back-projection & k-means for finding specific colors, then count cars of an enumeration of colors from a bridge mounted video feed.
2. Compare RANSAC & Hough transform for finding lines, then see if filing cabinets are open in a stream of images 5 seconds apart.
3. Find QR Codes in images, then recognise car logos.

### 2015
1. Detect & count pedestrians from an overhead video feed, then determine likely pedestrian matches from a camera feed nearby.
2. Distinguish nuts, bolts & washers on a conveyor belt, then use a different recognition technique to deal with if they could be overlapping.
3. Locate pedestrian crossings in a video feed from a car bonnet, then determine whether there are pedestrians on the crossing.

### 2014
1. Determine whether a bus is passing in a video feed, then recognise the number of the bus from an image of just the number part.
2. Determine Vanishing points associated with building faces, then recognise buildings given images of their fronts.
3. Smoothing & equalisation for both RGB & HLS and find best colors to represent part of an image, then compare & contrast two ways of locating faces in an image.

### 2013
1. Compare & contrast template matching, statistical pattern recognition & robust object recognition, then locate fire extinguishers in images and identify their type (from their labels' text).
2. Locate paintings in a gallery, then recognise them given images of the original paintings.
3. Describe 4 specific smoothing techniques and recommend one for different scenarios, then locate moving objects in a video feed inside a windy forest.

### 2012
1. Compare Sobel & Laplacian edge detection for creating binary edge images, then determine if windows are open or closed in images.
2. Background modelling & shadow detection in video, then classify vehicles & pedestrians in an overhead video feed of a carpark.
3. Locate roadsigns in an image using color & Hough, then use SIFT to keep track of them in a video feed from a car bonnet.

*The exam format was different before 2012 so I will not list the questions from those exams (though 2011's first half is sort of similar enough to possibly make note of)*

### 2011
1. Compare thresholding & opening vs median filtering & thresholding for preprocessing conveyor belt images for recognising nuts, screws & washers, then locate & identify them on a conveyor belt (possibly overlapping).
2. Compare non-maxima suppression in Moravec corner detection and non-maxima supression in Prewitt edge detection, then locate traffic lights in images using corners & determine their state.
3. Compare RGB, HLS & Chromaticity color spaces & how they represent specific colors and determine dominant colors in an image using one of them, then categorise sky/water/grass/forest/rocky terrain in an image using color & texture.
