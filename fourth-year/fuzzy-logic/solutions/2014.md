## 2014 Q1

### 1a)
**(This answer is not the same as the [model answer](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Khurshid.Ahmad/Teaching/Lectures_on_Fuzzy_Logic/Archive_2008/2007_2008_4BA13_Model_Solutions.pdf#page=2))**  
It would be possible to describe the set of all Bertie's mammals as a crisp set, like this:  
`A = {duck-billed platypus, echidnas, horses, zebras, tigers, whales, dolphins}`  
This is a crisp set because all elements have total membership in the set of *mammals*.

However Bertie thinks that these animals are mammals to certain *degrees*. Using a crisp set like this to describe what he considers as being *mammal* loses this information. To include how Bertie feels these animals are mammals to different *extents*, the set of mammals would be better described using a *fuzzy set* like this:  
`A = {0.5/duck-billed platypus, 0.5/echidnas, 1/horses, 1/zebras, 1/tigers, 0.1/whales, 0.1/dolphins}`

### 1b)
<code>A<sup>mammals</sup> = {0.5/duck-billed platypus, 0.5/echidnas, 1/horses, 1/zebras, 1/tigers, 0.1/whales, 0.1/dolphins,0/sparrows,0/robins,0/crows,0/penguins,0/kiwis}</code>

<code>A<sup>birds</sup> = {0/duck-billed platypus, 0/echidnas, 0/horses, 0/zebras, 0/tigers, 0/whales, 0/dolphins,1/sparrows,1/robins,1/crows,0.5/penguins,0.5/kiwis}</code>

### 1c)
<code>E<sup>mammals</sup> = {0.5/duck-billed platypus, 0.5/echidnas, 0/horses, 0/zebras, 0/tigers, 0.1/whales, 0.1/dolphins,0/sparrows,0/robins,0/crows,0/penguins,0/kiwis}</code>

### 1d)
The Law of Excluded Middle states that `A ∪ Ã = ∅`. However for A<sup>mammals</sup>:  
`A ∪ Ã = {0.5/duck-billed platypus, 0.5/echidnas, 1/horses, 1/zebras, 1/tigers, 0.9/whales, 0.9/dolphins,1/sparrows,1/robins,1/crows,1/penguins,1/kiwis}`  
Therefore A<sup>mammals</sup> also violates the Law of Excluded Middle.

The Law of Contradiction states that `A ∩ Ã = ∅`. However for A<sup>mammals</sup>:  
`A ∩ Ã = = {0.5/duck-billed platypus, 0.5/echidnas, 0/horses, 0/zebras, 0/tigers, 0.1/whales, 0.1/dolphins,0/sparrows,0/robins,0/crows,0/penguins,0/kiwis}`  
Therefore A<sup>mammals</sup> violates the Law of Contradiction.

## 2014 Q3

**Note to student readers: Maybe the nature of these problems is that there is information that seems to be contradictory, but it seems to me that this question is littered with errors.**

### 3a)

Here are the membership functions for the input and output term sets:

**NEGATIVE:**  
<code>𝝁<sub>NEGATIVE</sub>(x) = 1 if x ≤ -6</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>NEGATIVE</sub>(x) = (-3-x)/(-3-(-6)) if -6 < x < -3</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>NEGATIVE</sub>(x) = 0 if x ≥ -3</code>

I have taken that there is a mistake in the question, seeing as MIXED is defined as "Definitely True for `-6 ≤ x ≤ 6`" but also "Definitely False for `x ≤ -6 AND x ≥ 6`". Therefore I have made a changed the classification of MIXED to be *"Definitely False for `x < -6 && x > 6`"*. (The inputs -6 and 6 will no longer be both True and False)

**MIXED:**  
<code>𝝁<sub>MIXED</sub>(x) = 0 if x > -6</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>MIXED</sub>(x) = 1 if -6 ≤ x ≤ 6</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>MIXED</sub>(x) = 0 if x > 6</code>

**POSITIVE:**  
<code>𝝁<sub>POSITIVE</sub>(x) = 0 if x ≤ 2</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>POSITIVE</sub>(x) = 1-(6-x)/(6-2) if 2 < x < 6</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>POSITIVE</sub>(x) = 1 if x ≥ 6</code>

**SMALL:**  
<code>𝝁<sub>SMALL</sub>(x) = 1 if x ≤ 1.5</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>SMALL</sub>(x) = (2.5-x)/(2.5-1.5) if 1.5 < x < 2.5</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>SMALL</sub>(x) = 0 if x ≥ 2.5</code>

I have taken that there is a mistake in the question, seeing as MEDIUM is defined as "Definitely True for `1.5 ≤ x ≤ 7`" but also "Definitely False for `x ≥ 7`". Therefore I have made a changed the classification of MEDIUM to be *"Definitely False for `x > 7`"*. (The input 7 will no longer be both True and False)

There is also no details about values for Y that are below 1.5. Because of this, I will presume that for the classification of MEDIUM, all values below 1.5 are "Definitely False".

**MEDIUM:**  
<code>𝝁<sub>MEDIUM</sub>(x) = 0 if x < 1.5</code>   
<code>𝝁<sub>MEDIUM</sub>(x) = 1 if 1.5 ≤ x ≤ 7</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>MEDIUM</sub>(x) = 0 if x > 7</code>

I have taken that there is a mistake in the question, seeing as LARGE is defined as "Definitely True for `x ≥ 6`" but also "Definitely False for `x ≥ 5`". Therefore I have made a changed the classification of LARGE to be *"Definitely False for `x ≤ 5`"*. (The inputs less than or equal to 5 will be False)

**LARGE:**  
<code>𝝁<sub>LARGE</sub>(x) = 0 if x ≤ 5</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>LARGE</sub>(x) = 1-(6-x)/(6-5) if 5 < x < 6</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>LARGE</sub>(x) = 1 if x ≥ 6</code>

Here is the rule base governing the above mentioned SISO system:  

Rule 1: IF X is NEGATIVE THEN Y is SMALL
Rule 2: IF X is MIXED THEN Y is MEDIUM
Rule 3: IF X is POSITIVE THEN Y is LARGE

### 3bi)

For `x = 7`:

#### Fuzzification

<code>𝝁<sub>NEGATIVE</sub>(x) = 0</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>MIXED</sub>(x) = 0</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>POSITIVE</sub>(x) = 1</code>  

#### Inference

|Rule  |Firing Degree|
|------|-------------|
|Rule 1|            0|
|Rule 2|            0|
|Rule 3|            1|

Therefore we take it that Rule 3 is applied:  
*"IF X is POSITIVE THEN Y is LARGE"*

Because only Rule 3 fires, we know that Y is LARGE and that we should use the membership function <code>𝝁<sub>LARGE</sub>(y)</code> to calculate the output.

|y|<code>𝝁<sub>LARGE</sub>(x)</code>|
|---|---|
|0|0|
|1|0|
|2|0|
|3|0|
|4|0|
|5|0|
|6|1|
|7|1|
|8|1|
|9|1|
|10|1|

Because all of the outputs fire to the same extent, the **MOM** & **COG** are:  

`Output = ( 6*1 + 7*1 + 8*1 + 9*1 + 10*1 ) / ( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ) = 8`

### 3bii)

For `x = -7`:

|Rule  |Firing Degree|
|------|-------------|
|Rule 1|            1|
|Rule 2|            0|
|Rule 3|            0|

Therefore we take it that Rule 1 is applied:
*"IF X is NEGATIVE THEN Y is SMALL"*

Because only Rule 1 fires, we know that Y is SMALL and that we should use the membership function <code>𝝁<sub>LARGE</sub>(y)</code> to calculate the output.

|y|<code>𝝁<sub>SMALL</sub>(x)</code>|
|---|---|
|0|1|
|1|1|
|2|0.5|
|3|0|
|4|0|
|5|0|
|6|0|
|7|0|
|8|0|
|9|0|
|10|0|

**MOM**:  
The crisp value for the Mean of Maxima method is:

<code>( Σ alpha * x ) / ( Σ alpha )</code>

*where <code>alpha</code> is the maximum output value of the fuzzy set.*

The set is given an alpha level cut so that only values of x that give the maximum output value are used.

Using the above equation for the MOM method:  

`Output = ( 0*1 + 1*1 ) / ( 1 + 1 ) = 0.5`

**COG**:  
The crisp value for the Centre of Area method is:

<code>( Σ 𝝁<sub>LARGE</sub>(x) * x ) / 𝝁<sub>LARGE</sub>(x)</code>

*For the Centre of Area method, all values of x are used.*

`Output = ( 0*1 + 1*1 + 2*0.5 ) / ( 1 + 1 + 0.5 ) = 0.8`

## 2014 Q4

### Q4a)

I will use the linguistic variables with their term sets below:

`VOLTAGE = {SLOW_DOWN, SPEED_UP, NO_CHANGE}`

`SPEED = {TOO_SLOW,TOO_FAST,ABOUT_RIGHT}`

I will use the following symmetric triangular membership functions for each term:  
<img src="./assets/trimf.png"/>

with the following values for *a*,*b* & *c* for each term:  

|Parameter|SLOW_DOWN|SPEED_UP|NO_CHANGE|TOO_SLOW|TOO_FAST|ABOUT_RIGHT|
|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|
|        a|     2.32|    2.40|     2.38|    2304|    2420|       2391|
|        b|     2.36|    2.44|     2.40|    2362|    2478|       2420|
|        c|     2.40|    2.48|     2.42|    2420|    2536|       2449|

*The a and c is the lower and upper value of each fuzzy subset, and the b is the value half way between them.*

### Q4b)

It makes sense that voltage would be applied to:  
* SLOW_DOWN the motor if it was going TOO_FAST
* SPEED_UP the motor if it was going TOO_SLOW
* Give the motor NO_CHANGE if it was going at an ABOUT_RIGHT speed

Using this knowledge and the membership functions of the term sets of the linguistic variables, I will draw fuzzy patches to represent rules for the rule base to control the behaviour of the electric motor.

The fuzzy patches are the cartesian product of the linguistic variables.

<img src="./assets/2014Q4b.JPG"/>

So as you can see, the rule base is:

IF SPEED is TOO_FAST THEN VOLTAGE is SLOW_DOWN
IF SPEED is TOO_SLOW THEN VOLTAGE is SPEED_UP
IF SPEED is ABOUT_RIGHT THEN VOLTAGE is NO_CHANGE
