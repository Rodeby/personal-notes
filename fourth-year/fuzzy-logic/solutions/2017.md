## 2017 Q1

### 1a)
It would be possible to describe the set of all Bertie's mammals as a crisp set, like this:  
`A = {duck-billed platypus, echidnas, horses, zebras, tigers, whales, dolphins}`  
This is a crisp set because all elements have total membership in the set of *mammals*.  

However Bertie thinks that these animals are mammals to certain *degrees*. Using a crisp set like this to describe what he considers as being *mammal* loses this information. To include how Bertie feels these animals are mammals to different *extents*, the set of mammals would be better described using a *fuzzy set* like this:  
`A = {0.5/duck-billed platypus, 0.5/echidnas, 1/horses, 1/zebras, 1/tigers, 0.1/whales, 0.1/dolphins}`  

### 1b)
The Law of Contradiction states that `A ∩ Ã = ∅`. However for A<sup>mammals</sup>:  
`A ∩ Ã = {0.5/duck-billed platypus, 0.5/echidnas, 0/horses, 0/zebras, 0/tigers, 0.1/whales, 0.1/dolphins,0/sparrows,0/robins,0/crows,0/penguins,0/kiwis}`  
Therefore A<sup>mammals</sup> violates the Law of Contradiction.  

### 1c)

The three most cited functions in the literature are:

**T-Norm**:  
Minimum: <code>T<sub>min</sub> = min(a,b) = a 𝚲 b;</code>  
Algebraic Product: <code>T<sub>AP</sub> = ab;</code>  
Bounded Product: <code>T<sub>BP</sub> = 0 V (a + b - 1);</code>  

**S-Norm**:  
Maximum: <code>S(a,b) = max(a,b) = a V b;</code>  
Algebraic Sum: <code>S(a,b) = a + b - ab;</code>  
Bounded Sum: <code>S(a,b) = 1 𝚲 (a + b);</code>  

The one main implication of using these triangular norms in fuzzy decision making is that defuzzification cannot be uniquely specified.  

It can be verified that, for example by choosing different values of *a* & *b*, the following inequalities hold:  
<code>T<sub>BP</sub> ≤ T<sub>AP</sub> ≤ T<sub>mind</sub>;</code>  
<code>S<sub>max</sub>(a,b) ≤ S<sub>AP</sub>(a,b) ≤ S<sub>BP</sub>(a,b);</code>  
These requirements for T-norm & T-conorm functions cannot uniquely determine the classical fuzzy intersection and union (namely the min & max operators).

**Note to student readers: This is the same as the [model answer](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lnfr37xev6ozm9l/AADSnjWY_82WSDjmggzTTb4Ba/CS4001-%20Fuzzy%20Logic/papers/Sample%20Answers?dl=0&preview=2014_CS4001_May+_Questions_ModelSolutionsExam.pdf), but I can't do any better than that!**

### 2b)

The velocity can be characterised by a trapezoidal membership function:  
<img src="./assets/tramf.png"/>  

The **Core** of the velocity fuzzy set will be the values from *b* to *c*.

The **Support** of the velocity fuzzy set will be the values from *a* to *d*.

### 2c)

#### 2ci)    
Crisp Statement: If A THEN B;  
Fuzzy Statement: If A(𝝁<sub>A</sub>) THEN B(𝝁<sub>B</sub>)  

#### 2cii)  
Crisp Statement: A is_a_part_of B  
Fuzzy Statement: For all x of X, 𝝁<sub>A</sub>(x) ≤ 𝝁<sub>B</sub>(x)   

#### 2ciii)  
**Note to student readers: I am unable to come up with how the following crisp relation could be translated into fuzzy logic in any sort of way. The difficult to decipher model answer can be found [here](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Khurshid.Ahmad/Teaching/Lectures_on_Fuzzy_Logic/Model_Answers.pdf#page=4).**  
Crisp Relation:  
```
A:= 5
If A < 5 then B:=A+5.
```  
Fuzzy Relation:  
```
TODO: ?
```

#### 2civ)
Crisp Statement: A weighs 5 kilo-grammes;  
Fuzzy Statement: A weighs about 5 kilo-grammes  

#### 2cv)
**Note to student readers: I have not been able to verify this answer.**  
Crisp Relation: Ā (donoting that A is false)  
Fuzzy Relation: 1-A to denote the fuzzy set Ā where 𝝁<sub>Ā</sub>(x) is 1-𝝁<sub>A</sub>(x).  

#### 2cvi)
Crisp Relation: A belongs_to class B, so Ā does not belong_to B  
Fuzzy Relation:  
In a fuzzy relation, this relationship is not true. In fuzzy logic:  
<code>𝝁<sub>A</sub>(x) ≤ 𝝁<sub>B</sub>(x) for all x of X</code>  
Does not necessarily mean that the following will not be true:  
<code>(1-𝝁<sub>A</sub>(x)) ≤ 𝝁<sub>B</sub>(x)</code>

## 2017 Q3

### 3a)

**Note to student readers: I have not been able to verify this answer.**  

The key difference between a Mamdani-type fuzzy system and the TSK system is:  
A Zero-Order TSK model can be viewed as a special case of a Mamdani system where each rule is specified by fuzzy singleton or a pre-defuzzified consequent.  
In TSK, each rule has a crisp output, the overall input is obtained by a weighted average - avoiding the time consuming defuzzification in Mamdani.

TSK is an approximation of Mamdani, as it ignores fuzziness in the consequent but accounts for fuzziness in the antecedent while Mamdani takes into account fuzziness in both the antecedent and the consequent.

#### 3bi)

<code>𝝁<sub>COLD</sub>(1) = 0.09</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>COOL</sub>(1) = 0.08</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>PLEASANT</sub>(1) = 0</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>WARM</sub>(1) = 0</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>HOT</sub>(1) = 0</code>  

Rule 1 has firing degree 0.9.   
Rule 2 has firing degree 0.08.  

SPEED = `(0*0.09 + 30*0.08)/(0.9+0.08) = 2.449)`

#### 3bii)

<code>𝝁<sub>COLD</sub>(10) = 0</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>COOL</sub>(10) = 0.8</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>PLEASANT</sub>(10) = 0</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>WARM</sub>(10) = 0</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>HOT</sub>(10) = 0</code>  

Rule 2 has firing degree 0.08.  

SPEED = `(30*0.08)/(0.8) = 30`

#### 3biii)

<code>𝝁<sub>COLD</sub>(16) = 0</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>COOL</sub>(16) = 0.3</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>PLEASANT</sub>(16) = 0.4</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>WARM</sub>(16) = 0</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>HOT</sub>(16) = 0</code>  

Rule 2 has firing degree 0.3.  
Rule 3 has firing degree 0.4.  

SPEED = `(30*0.3 + 50*0.4)/(0.3+0.4) = 41.428`

### 3c)

**Note to student readers: I have not been able to verify this answer.**  

The corresponding **First-Order** TSK Controller's rule base will look like this:  
IF TEMP is COLD THEN SPEED = j<sub>1</sub> + k<sub>1</sub> * T  
IF TEMP is COOL THEN SPEED = j<sub>2</sub> + k<sub>2</sub> * T  
IF TEMP is PLEASANT THEN SPEED = k<sub>3</sub>  
IF TEMP is WARM THEN SPEED = j<sub>4</sub> + k<sub>4</sub> * T  
IF TEMP is HOT THEN SPEED = k<sub>5</sub>  

With j<sub>i</sub> & k<sub>i</sub> being constants that need to be defined.

*A TSK controller does not have membership functions for fuzzy terms in its output.*

TODO: ... I do not know how to *"compute"* the membership functions for these output terms.

## 2017 Q4

### 4a

Beginning of bend (X<sub>1</sub>): `9.95`  
Inner barrier (X<sub>2</sub>): `30`  
Direction X<sub>3</sub>: `0`

**Fuzzification:**  
<code>𝝁<sub>SMALL</sub>(X<sub>1</sub>) = 0.801</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>MEDIUM</sub>(X<sub>1</sub>) = UNDEFINED</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>LONGWAY</sub>(X<sub>1</sub>) = UNDEFINED</code>  

<code>𝝁<sub>MIN</sub>(X<sub>2</sub>) = 0.25</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>MAX</sub>(X<sub>2</sub>) = 0.167</code>  

<code>𝝁<sub>OUTWARDS</sub>(X<sub>3</sub>) = UNDEFINED</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>INWARD</sub>(X<sub>3</sub>) = UNDEFINED</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>FORWARD</sub>(X<sub>3</sub>) = 1</code>  

**Inference:**  
The following rules fire to the following degrees:  
Rule 1: `min(0.801,0.25,1) = 0.25`  
Rule 3: `min(0.801,0.167,1) = 0.167`  

*I am making the assumption that Rule 4 is supposed to contain the term 'MEDIUM' rather than 'MODERATE'.*

**Composition:**  
<code>𝝶<sub>1</sub> = 0.25 - 0.02(9.95) + 0.06(30) - 0.05(0) = 1.851</code>  
<code>𝝶<sub>3</sub> = 3 - 0.02(9.95) + 0.02(0) = 2.801</code>  

`Output = (0.25*1.851 + 0.167*2.801)/(0.25+0.167) = 2.231`

### 4b

Beginning of bend (X<sub>1</sub>): `65.1`  
Inner barrier (X<sub>2</sub>): `30`  
Direction X<sub>3</sub>: `-30`

**Fuzzification:**  
<code>𝝁<sub>SMALL</sub>(X<sub>1</sub>) = 0.83</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>MEDIUM</sub>(X<sub>1</sub>) = UNDEFINED</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>LONGWAY</sub>(X<sub>1</sub>) = UNDEFINED</code>  

<code>𝝁<sub>MIN</sub>(X<sub>2</sub>) = 0.25</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>MAX</sub>(X<sub>2</sub>) = 0.167</code>  

<code>𝝁<sub>OUTWARDS</sub>(X<sub>3</sub>) = 0.25</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>INWARD</sub>(X<sub>3</sub>) = UNDEFINED</code>  
<code>𝝁<sub>FORWARD</sub>(X<sub>3</sub>) = 0</code>  

**Inference:**  
The following rules fire to the following degrees:  
Rule 4: `min(0.83,0.25,0.25) = 0.25`  

*I am making the assumption that Rule 4 is supposed to contain the term 'MEDIUM' rather than 'MODERATE'.*

**Composition:**  
<code>𝝶<sub>4</sub> = 3 - 0.02(65.1) + 0.01(30) - 0.04(-30) = 3.198</code>  

`Output = (0.25*3.198)/(0.25) = 3.198`
