# Human Factors Past Questions

Here are all the questions that have been asked since 2008 (The first year of the module).

The exam paper was written by Gavin Doherty every year except 2009. The questions from that paper have been omitted from this document.

The Human Factors exam papers are **extremely** similar each year. I have combined questions that differ only in a sentence or word, when compiling this list. If that doesn't suit you, you can see them all unaltered [here](https://github.com/nating/personal-notes/blob/master/fourth-year/human-factors/human-factors-questions.md).

Questions are ordered by their frequency.

*The exam is made up of three questions each worth 50 marks. Candidates answer Questions 1 and ONE other question.*

## Q1 (Mandatory)

**1a) (2018,2017,2016,2015,2014,2013,2012,2011,2010,2008)**  
Identify the main tasks in the above application and present an analysis of these tasks. Your analysis should include a hierarchical task decomposition, but should use the tasks identified as the starting point for a broader analysis that goes beyond that. [35 Marks]

**1b) (2018,2017,2016,2015,2014,2013,2012,2011,2010)**  
Explain how your analysis would effect the design of the system, giving concrete examples of the design decisions which would be influenced by the analysis. You may use a small number of user interface sketches to illustrate your answer as appropriate. [15 Marks]

## Q2 & Q3

*The questions in Q2 and Q3 come up in either over the years, so they have been included here together.*

**(2017,2015,2014,2013,2011)**  
Which techniques for improving usability would be most important to the above system? Justify your choices and describe how you would apply them to the development of the above system. [25 Marks]

**(2015,2014,2013,2011,2008)**  
Explain Norman's model of interaction using an example from the above system. [10 Marks]

**(2018,2017,2015,2014,2011)**  
Identify three usability metrics relevant to the above system, explain why they are important, and how you would measure them. What values would you compare the measured results to? [15 Marks]

**(2017,2015,2014,2012)**  
Explain the advantages of the MVC User Interface Architecture (and what it is), using an example from the above system. [10 Marks]

**(2018,2017,2015,2014)**  
Consider opportunities for error when using the above system, and describe how they might be detected, tolerated or recovered from. Your consideration of error can be broad, and include failure to achieve goals relevant to the system. Make use of the SRK framework where it is helpful to your analysis and include user-interface sketches to illustrate your answer where appropriate. [25 Marks]

**(2016,2013,2011)** (This question is the same as above apart from the keyword 'human')  
Consider opportunities for **human** error when using the above system, and describe how they might be detected, tolerated or recovered from. Make use of the SRK framework where it is helpful to your analysis and include user-interface sketches to illustrate your answer where appropriate. [25 Marks]

**(2012,2010)**  
Explain how and when you would involve users in the design and evaluation of the above system. Detail how each of the activities you propose would result in a better quality system. [25 Marks]

**(2012,2010)**  
Describe in detail how you would conduct a late-stage usability evaluation of the above system, including what you would measure and how. Your answer should include the design of the evaluations, and should consider the different options available. [25 Marks]

**(2011,2008)**  
Describe in detail how you would conduct usability evaluations of the above system at any stage. Your answer should include the design of the evaluations, and should consider the different options available. [25 Marks]

**(2018,2016)**  
Describe an overall design process which you would recommend be applied in the development of the above system. Justify your choice. You should provide a plan for the activities but you do not need to consider timescales or person months. [25 Marks]

**(2018, 2016)**  
Discuss the issue of awareness (from a CSCW perspective) with respect to the above system. Include all users within your analysis. [10 Marks 2018, 15 Marks 2016]

**(2018,2015,2014)**  
Discuss the significance of external information representations in the above system. [15 Marks]

**(2018)**
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of labratory-based vs. field-based evaluations with respect to the above system. [10 Marks]

**(2010)**  
Consider opportunities for error when using the above system and discuss using examples how a design for the above system can help to prevent errors, and help operators to identify, diagnose and recover from these errors. [25 Marks]

**(2008)**  
How would you ensure the usability of the above system? Your answer should consider the entire development process, and should make clear the benefit of each of the activities you propose to the development of the above system. [35 Marks]

**(2008)**  
Identify three usability guidelines or heuristics which would be applicable to the above system, and explain using examples why these guidelines are appropriate. [15 Marks]

**(2013)**  
Discuss the differences in the form factors and contexts of use of the device might impact on the design of the system. [15 Marks]

**(2016)**  
Discuss the potential roles of automation within the above system, and the difficulties which might arise from the use of automation. Your answer should consider automation within the information system, and not the mechanical automation. [10 Marks]

**(2017)**  
Analyse how the use of computer-mediated communication between the host and guest might be employed, how it could impact (positively or negatively) on the operation of the service, and how you would investigate these issues during the design process. [25 Marks]

**(2012)**  
Present an analysis of the above system from a distributed cognition perspective, and explain how this would differ from a more traditional task-based analysis. [25 Marks]

**(2013)**  
What measures of success would be most relevant for the above system? Describe how you would measure and maximise these within the development process.[25 Marks]

**(2012)**  
Describe how you would ensure the system is accessible to all interested users, and provide examples of how this might impact on the design of the system. [15 Marks]

**(2011)**  
Outline the different ways in which user capabilities might impact on the operation of the above system and comment on how this might impact on the design of the system. [15 Marks]

**(2010)**  
Outline the main features of the Distributed Cognition view of the performance of work. Analyse the above system from a Distributed Cognition viewpoint. [25 Marks]

**(2016)**  
Discuss whether you would use a participatory design approach for any part of the above system, and explain why. [10 Marks]
