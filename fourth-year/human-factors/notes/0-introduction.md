## Introduction

Interaction can be **Direct** or **Indirect**. An example of indirect interaction is automatic doors, or lights that come on when you enter a room.

**HCI** stands for Human Computer Interaction.

Helpful systems are:

|      |   |
|------|---|
|**Useful**|Help users accomplish their goal.
|**Usable**|Are easy to use and not dangerous.
|**Used**  |People want to use them.

There are things called **Cognitive Dimensions** that Gavin refers to as if we know them. These are essentially design principals, but specifically [14 ones that two guys came up with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dimensions_of_notations).

A system is not considered usable if a user can't use it, or if human error is highly likely.

A User is **NOT** happy if they:  
* Can't work out how to do something
* Are not able to do something
* Make the same error over and over
* Make an error with a massive consequence
* Do something that takes longer than it should
* Are not happy with the way the system looks

Three questions to ask yourself before designing system interaction:  
* Who are the users?
* What activities are being carried out?
* Where is the interaction taking place?

**Usability Goals üòç:**  
* Effective
* Efficient
* Safe
* Useful
* Easy
* Easy to remember how to use (*git is easy but it can be hard to remember commands as a newbie*)

Human Factors include:  
* Cognitive Capabilities
* Physical Capabilities
* Social & Cultural Influences

Environmental Factors include:  
* Lighting
* Noise
* Time Pressure (? *"wtf"* - me)

Disadvantages of automation may include:  
* Increased probability of system error
* Operators become less skilled at low level tasks
* Operators become bored or complacent (may lose situation awareness)
* Can increase operator workload

**Dialogue** is a term that is used for the interaction between a system and a user.

**User goals** are to solve a problem or to accomplish a task.

Good Design could be:  
* Focused specifically for the particular user of the system
* Focused on supporting specific tasks of the user
* Consistent
* Including Informative feedback & error messages
* Offering easy reversal of actions
* Reducing the short term memory load of the user

Measurable factors of success include:  

|||
|---|---|
|Ease of Learning|How much time & training is required for a new user to perform competently with the system?|
|Productivity|How quickly and efficiently can tasks be performed?|
|Error rates|How many errors do users make using the system?|
|User Satisfaction|How satisfied are users with the system?|
|Market Share|What share of the market do you have?|
|Customer Support|How much customer support is needed?|
