## Prototyping

Prototypes are useful for:
* Getting evaluation and feedback for interaction design
* Allowing stakeholders to interact with the design
* Testing out ideas
* Helping designers to choose between designs

The **Breadth** of a prototype is how much of the feature set it covers.

The **Depth** of a prototype is the degree of functionality there is for each feature.

**Low-fidelity Prototyping** uses a medium which is unlike the final medium. It is quick, cheap & easily changed.

Paper Prototypes are good because:
* They can be put together fast.
* The are easy to change.
* Designers don't waste time on details.
* People who can't code can still help.

**Wizard-of-Oz** prototyping is where *"the user thinks they are interacting with a computer but a developer is responding to output rather than the system."*

**High-fidelity Prototyping** uses materials that you would expect to be in the final product.

In **Participatory Design** a *"user is an active member of the design team."*
