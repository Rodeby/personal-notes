## Usability Testing

Usability involves recording performance of typical users doing typical tasks.

*"Usability is applied experimentation."*

**Usability Testing**:  
* Is done to improve products.
* Has only a few participants.
* Informs design.
* Is not usually replicable.
* Has conditions controlled as much as possible.
* Has a planned procedure.
* Has its results reported back to developers.

With Usability Testing, the focus is on:  
* The time it takes users to complete a task.
* The amount of errors that are made completing tasks.
* The types of errors that are made completing tasks.

Usability Testing is done in a **Usability Lab** or some other controlled space.

An emphasis is put on selecting representative users and developing representative tasks.

Usually only 5-10 users are selected and the tasks last no longer than 30 minutes.

The test conditions should be the same for every participant.

Some types of data that can be recorded during Usability Testing include:  
* Time to complete a task
* Time to complete a task after a specified time away from the product
* Number and type of errors per task
* Number of errors per unit time
* Number of navigations to online help or manuals
* Number of users making a particular error
* Number of users completing a task successfully
* Eye Fixations & Scan Path

Usability Testing find the current level of performance which becomes the minimum acceptable level of performance.

The amount of participants depends on:  
* The schedule
* The availability of participants
* The cost of running tests

*"Some experts argue that testing should continue until no new insights are gained."*

There are three types of **Experimental Design**: Different-Participants, Same-Participants & Matched-Participants.

**Matched Participants** is where participants are matched based on *"expertise, gender, etc."* across the change in condition of the experiment.

Here are the advantages & disadvantages of the different types of experimental design:  

|Design|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|---|---|---|
|Different|The order doesn't effect the experiment|Different subjects introduce biases|
|Same|There are fewer participants & no differences|The ordering of the experiment may bias it|
|Matched|The order doesn't matter, but there are less differences between subjects|Can not be sure of perfect matching|
