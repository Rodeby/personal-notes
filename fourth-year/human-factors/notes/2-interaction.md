## Interaction

A **Domain** (in Gavin's contexts) includes the area of work under study, the tasks & the goals of each task.

**Norman's Theory of action** is these 7 stages of an activity:  
* Establish a goal
* Form an intention
* Specify an action sequence
* Execute an action
* Perceive the system state
* Interpret the state
* Evaluate the system state with respect to the goals and intentions

In the above, a **goal** could be *get more light* but an **intention** could be *switch on the lamp*.

Gavin's slides say that Norman's theory is not realistic because:  
* Human activity is not as orderly & sequential
* Stages are usually missed or repeated
* Humans do not always have a goal in mind
* It is greatly simplified

Gavin writes that Norman's theory helps designers to think about how to help users monitor their actions.

**Gulfs** refer to gaps that exist between what the user wants/expects and what the system actually does/has/allows.

Two **Human Errors** are slips and mistakes.

A **Slip** is when a user correctly understands the system and formulates the action, but then performs an incorrect action.

A **Mistake** is when *"may not even have right goal"* - Gavin.

To minimise slips, design a better interface design.

To minimise mistakes, give users a better understanding of the system.

Examples of **Ergonomics** in design are:  
* Arrangement of controls and displays
* Seating
* Color of UI elements

A touch screen interface is cheaper and more flexible than a mechanical one, but may *"lose context"*(?).

**WIMP** stands for 'Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers'.
