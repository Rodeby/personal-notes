## Cooperative Work

**Computer-Supported Cooperative Work** (*CSCW*) addresses how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems.

Gavin talks about CSCW as *"The field of study that examines design, adoption and use of groupware"* *"NOT restricted to 'cooperation' or 'work' but also examines competition, socialising and play"*.

Ease-of-use must be better for groupware because the pace of use of an application is often driven by the pace of a conversation.

The motivation for groupware is:  
* To make communication faster & clearer.
* Te enable communication where it wouldn't otherwise be possible.
* To enable telecommuting (people working from home).
* To cut down travel costs.
* To bring together multiple perspectives and expertise.
* To form groups with common interests where it wouldn't be possible to gather a sufficient number of people face-to-face.
* To save time and cost in coordinating group work.
* To facilitate group problem solving.
* To enable new modes of communication. (such as anonymous changes or structured interactions)

Groupware can be classified according to when & where the participants are performing the cooperative work:

||Same Place|Different Place|
|---|---|---|
|Same Time|Face-to-Face conversation|Telephone|
|Different Time|Post-it note|Letter|

Groupware can also be classified by its function:

||Co-Located|Remote|
|---|---|---|
|Synchronous|Meeting Rooms with shared PC's & windows|Video Conferences with shared windows|
|Asynchronous|Shared Whiteboard|Email|

**WYSIWIS** stands for *What you see is what I see* and refers to a paradigm in the design of multiuser interfaces where multiple users, interacting with a multiuser software system, share the same visual perception of the work area.

There are different levels of sharing, with WYSIWIS being the highest level.

**Awareness** in collaborative systems refers to having an idea of what other participants are doing or have been doing. It refers to aspects that demand little conscious effort or attention as opposed to something that allows you to explicitly find out what others are doing.

Cooperative work involves:  
* **Participants** who are working.
* **Artefacts** upon which they work.

*"All computer systems have group impact - not just groupware!"*

**Deictic** means relating to or denoting a word or expression whose meaning is dependent on the context in which it is used.

**Deixis** is the function or use of deictic words, forms, or expressions.

A **Back Channel** is a sound or gesture made to give continuity to a conversation by a person who is listening to another.

Restricting media restricts back channels.

There are two types of context in conversation:  
* **External Context**: Reference to the environment. *"(thing being pointed to)"*
* **Internal Context**: Reference to the environment. *('"that"')*

Resolving context depends on sharing meaning.

Context is essential for disambiguation.

**Speech Act** theory is a form of conversational analysis where utterances are considered to be *acts* characterised by what they do. E.g. "I'm hungry" has a propositional meaning: -> "get me some food".

An **Illocutionary Point** is the basic purpose of a speaker in making an utterance.

**MDT** stands for **Multi-Disiplinary Team**.

**Text Based Communication** is the most common media for asynchronous groupware.

Successful **Grounding** in communication requires parties "to coordinate both the content and process"

There are several **Grounding Constraints** present in some forms of communication:  

|Grounding Constraint|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Contemporality|Utterance is heard as soon as it is made|
|Simultaneity|Speaking together|
|Sequence|Utterances are ordered|
|Reviewability|Previous utterances can be reviewed|
|Revisability|A message can be revised before being sent|
|Visibility|Group members can see eachother|
|Audibility|Group members can see eachother speak|
|Copresence (or *colocation*)|Group members are in the same location|

Strategies to increase granularity include:
* **Eagerness**: Looking ahead in conversation. "Cup of tea? One sugar?"
* **Multiplexing**: Several topics in one utterance. "No thanks. Cold isn't it?"

A **Co-ordination Mechanism** is the combination of an artefact & a protocol surrounding its use.

**Ethnography** is the scientific description of peoples and cultures with their customs, habits, and mutual differences.

In participatory design, workers enter into design context. In ethnography, designers enter into work context. Both of these make workers feel valued in design, encouraging them to "own" the products and work hard to ensure they are as good as can be.

The benefits and effort put into groupware can be disproportionate. For example, with a shared diary the secretaries and subordinates enter data and so it is easy for the manager to arrange meetings. As a result the groupware falls into disuse.

 **Critical Mass** is the minimum amount of resources required to start or maintain some venture.

 It is difficult to measure the benefits or success of groupware.

 Gavin on groupware: *"Developers cannot rely on their own individual informed intuition when gropu processes are concerned."* ... *"Involve real users early on in the design process."*
