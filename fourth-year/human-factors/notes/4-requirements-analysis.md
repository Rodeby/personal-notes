## Requirements Analysis

When establishing requirements, ask yourself:  
What do users want?  
What do users need?

**Functional Requirements** are what the system should do.

**Non-Functional Requirements** are how well the system will do what it should.

**Personas** are not real people but are synthesised by real user characteristics.

Gavin says that personas are useful for avoiding building what users ask for rather than what they will actually use. And that the design efforts can be prioritised based on what is most important to users.

Ways of gathering data for requirements include:  
* Interviews
* Focus Groups
* Questionnaires
* Researching similar products
* Direct observation
* Indirect observation
* Studying documentation

|Process|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|
|Interviews|Good for exploring issues|Time consuming & may be infeasable
|Focus Groups|Good for gaining consensus view|Can be dominated by individuals
|Questionnaires|Good for answering specific questions from a dispersed group of people|Should be used in conjunction with other techniques
|Researching similar products|Good for prompting requirements quickly|
|Direct observation|Good for gaining insight into stakeholder tasks|Requires time commitment from a member of the design team & can result in a huge amount of data
|Indirect observation|*"Good for logging current tasks"*?|*"Not often used in requirements activity"*?
|Studying documentation|Good source of data about steps involved in an activity, takes no stakeholder time|Not to be used in isolation

Problems with data gathering include:
* Domain knowledge is distributed and implicit
* Some knowledge is difficult to articulate
* Political problems in organisations can interfere
* Functional & Usability demands have to be balanced
* The economic & business environment can change during the process

Guidelines for gathering requirements:
* Focus on identifying stakeholders' needs
* Involve all stakeholder groups
* Involve more than one representative from each stakeholder group
* Use a combination of data gathering techniques
* Support the process with props such as prototypes & task descriptions

A **Scenario** is a simple, informal narrative and is not generalisable.

Scenarios include:
* Actors
* Background information on actors
* Assumptions about the environment
* Goals & Objectives
* Sequences of action and events

The advantages of scenarios are:
* They are linear
* They are easy to understand
* They are concrete (less likely to have errors in their creation)

The disadvantages of scenarios are:
* They have no choice/branches/special conditions

An **Essential Use Case** will *"abstract away from the details"* and *"Does not have the same assumptions as use cases"*.

A **Task Model** is a detailed breakdown of steps involved & should avoid committing to implementation details.

In **Task Analysis**, you must ask yourself: *"What are people trying to achieve?"* & *"Why are they trying to achieve it?"*.

**Task Decomposition** is splitting tasks into ordered subtasks.

**HTA** stands for Hierarchical Task Analysis, and focuses on physical and observable actions not related to software *"or an interaction device"*(?).

TODO: Explain how to draw the perfect HTA.

To **Afford** is to provide or supply an opportunity or facility. (A handle affords grasping etc.)

**Perceived Affordance** refers to what a person think can be done with an object.
