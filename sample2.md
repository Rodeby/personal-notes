Identification

*All possible risks* **As many risks as possible** are identified for *every* **each** component of the system.

Classification

Each of the risks identified are classified in terms of impact and probability, e.g. as having Low/Medium/High impact and Low/Medium/High probability **to normalise the importance of mitigating each risk**. Once the risks have been classified this way, they are ordered by their impact and probability so that the biggest impact / most likely risks are found at the top of the list.

Mitigation

A mitigation is *done* **designed** for the risk at the top of the list.

Iteration

After the mitigation of the top risk, the list of risks is **re-analysed** reordered as necessary, because the mitigation for the top risk may have had an effect on the impact or likelihood of other risks in the list.  The top risk is then again mitigated.

Termination

*Eventually* **In practice** this *iteration* **process** ends when efforts have been expended. Time and money mean that a mitigation may not be designed for the entire list of risks.
